# (Not yet) Portable utility designed to aid in connecting ADB wireless devices designed in C++

___
## TODO (not in order of priority):
___

#### [&ensp;] Release dependencies (integrate avahi & dig directly into source)
##### &emsp;[&ensp;] avahi
##### &emsp;[&ensp;] dig (only reverse dns lookup is necessary)

#### [&ensp;] Allow multiple devices
##### &emsp;[&ensp;] Device picker (if multiple found)

#### [&ensp;] Allow device pairing if not paired

#### [&ensp;] Check if found device is already paired without connecting (Is that even possible?)
